## Vision

**StudentCredentialChain** aims to leverage Ethereum blockchain technology to create a decentralized system for managing and verifying student credentials. Our vision is to offer a secure, transparent, and immutable solution that enhances trust and reduces administrative overhead in academic record management.

## Flowchart

![Flowchart](./flowchart.png)

*The flowchart illustrates the interaction between users, the smart contract, and the blockchain.*

1. **User Actions:**
   - **Add Student Record:** Input student details into the dApp.
   - **Update Student Record:** Modify existing records.
   - **Retrieve Student Record:** Fetch details using student ID.

2. **Smart Contract Operations:**
   - **Deploy Contract:** Deploy to the Ethereum network.
   - **Function Calls:** Execute functions like `addStudent`, `updateStudent`, `getStudent`.

3. **Blockchain Interaction:**
   - **Record Storage:** Store records securely on the blockchain.
   - **Event Logging:** Record changes and updates on-chain.

## Contract Address

- **Testnet (Rinkeby):** `0xeb16424cf5358b2e263a4c849dd95cd59fa64b89`
- **Mainnet:** `0xeb16424cf5358b2e263a4c849dd95cd59fa64b89` (To be deployed)

Ensure you use the correct network for interactions to avoid transaction issues.

## Future Scope

- **Enhanced Security:** Implement role-based access and encryption.
- **Improved UI:** Develop a more intuitive user interface.
- **Scalability:** Explore layer 2 solutions or other blockchain platforms.
- **Integration:** Collaborate with educational institutions for automated record management.
